def dose_symmetric_tilts(maxtilt, step, nreflect):
    """
    Generates a sequence of symmetric positive and negative tilt angles
    based on the given maximum tilt, step size, and reflection group size.

    The function first creates arrays of positive and negative tilts, then
    iteratively adds a set number (`nreflect`) of positive and negative tilts
    in an alternating pattern until all possible tilts are used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    maxtilt : float
        The maximum absolute tilt angle to generate (positive and negative).
    step : float
        The step size between consecutive tilt angles.
    nreflect : int
        The number of tilt angles to alternate between positive and negative
        in each reflection group.

    Returns
    -------
    tilts : list of float
        A list of tilt angles arranged in alternating positive and negative
        groups, symmetrically distributed.

    Example
    -------
    >>> dose_symmetric_tilts(10, 2, 3)
    [0, 2, 4, -2, -4, 6, 8, -6, -8]

    # Create an array of positive tilt values ranging from 0 to (maxtilt).
    # step/10 max np.arange inclusive

    # Create an array of negative tilt values ranging from -step to -(maxtilt - step).

def generate_montage_shifts(overlap_factor, tiles, detector_pixels, shift=[0.0, 0.0]):
    """
    Generates a list of montage shift coordinates to cover a large area using a grid
    of overlapping detector tiles. The generated coordinates represent shifts in pixel
    space required to position the montage tiles, accounting for the overlap between tiles
    and shifting the grid each tilt to avoid excessive dose on any particular region.

    Parameters
    ----------
    overlap_factor : list or tuple of float
        A list or tuple of two values representing the fractional overlap in the x and y
        directions between adjacent tiles. Values should be between 0 and 1.
    tiles : tuple of int
        The number of tiles in the x (width) and y (height) directions (n, m).
    detector_pixels : list or tuple of int
        The dimensions of the detector in pixels (nx, ny).
    shift : list or tuple of float, optional
        An optional initial shift to apply to the montage coordinates in the x and y
        directions. Default is [0.0, 0.0].

    Returns
    -------
    coords : ndarray of shape (n_tiles, 2)
        An array of coordinates in pixel space, where each row corresponds to the shift
        needed for a particular tile in the montage. The x and y shifts are provided
        relative to the detector center.

    Notes
    -----
    - The function calculates the montage shifts such that the center of the grid is
      positioned at (0, 0), with each tile shifted by an amount determined by the overlap
      factor.
    - The x coordinates reverse direction on each row (serpentine or zigzag pattern) to
      minimize the magnitude of successive shifts.
    - The y coordinates are calculated to ensure coverage based on the overlap and tile
      dimensions.

    -------
    >>> generate_montage_shifts([0.1, 0.1], (3, 3), [1024, 1024])
